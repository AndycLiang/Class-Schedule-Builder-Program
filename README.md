Hello! I created this program to help me pick classes for my schedule in college by quickly identifying classes that are in conflict with one another. The file to execute is "ScheduleBuilderGUI.py", which imports "GraphWeek.py" and "ScheduleBuilder.py" as supporting programs. Upon executing ScheduleBuilderGUI.py, you see a GUI where you can enter as many classes as you are considering, up to 10, and as many alternate times as you want (the same class with different sections or times available). When you press submit, the program calculates any possible combinations of the classes you input and displays which sections have a time conflict. GraphWeek.py adds another handy feature as you can pick one of the available combinations and view what the week will look like visually. If anyone would like to use this program or contribute additional features, feel free to reach out!
